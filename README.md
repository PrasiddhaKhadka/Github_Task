# Documentation for Task 03


## 🚀 Overview
This project is designed to demonstrate best practices for version control and collaboration using Git and GitHub.

## 📁 Branch Strategy
We follow a branching strategy to maintain code quality and promote teamwork:

- `main`: Stable release-ready code
- `dev`: Ongoing development
- `feature/*`: Individual feature branches

## 🔀 Workflow
1. Clone the repository.
2. Create a new feature branch from `dev`:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
